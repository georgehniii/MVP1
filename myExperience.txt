My experience with this project was very rewarding. Being my first full-stack project, there were many hurdles I had to get over and many new things I have learned. I learned that using jquery for HTTP requests can cause problems more than what makes sense. Using javascript fetch is more stable. I also found that I could plug data into HTML class to transfer it "easier", but I do not believe that is a proper way to do such a thing. Using local memory would be better which I plan to move that process over to. The next thing I learned and liked is modularity. I broke my javascript files into parts to make them easier to handle and module. Although, I believe that I should break it down a little more. Next, using git properly and switching between debugging locally and deployed. Debugging locally and double-checking your work before you deploy is for now the best way I have found to work on a deployed program. This project was very rewarding and informative to me allowing me to build on my skills and knowledge.
