This is my first real fullstack project.
It should take information from a database and display it on a web page.
Some user interface involved.
You can check out the web app at this link: [aqueous-river-55015.herokuapp.com](http://aqueous-river-55015.herokuapp.com/)
I will be updating this more soon. For now it has full functionallity.
